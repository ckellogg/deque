/*This was a good 1st program. It has been a while for me with C++ and needs some refreshing.
This program was hard because I have not used pointers in a while. As well as some new libraries that I never have used.
I talked with others for explination of pointers and how to use them. As well as some errors that were coming from the debugger.
The debugger was hard to get working because I started out on Cloud9 which doesnâ€™t have all the need debugger to run the asserts.
I ended up moving over to Visual Studio 2015 to do the program. The memcpy was new to me and still trying to make sure I understand it all the way.
As well as size_t was new but I think I get that now. The const being used is still a little fusy and would like more clarity on it.
I learned some new things about pointers and how to use them better. I learned that even though sometimes a project seems easy it is not.
I learned what assert was. I leared templates which was good as I never had to write one before.
Overall the project was channeling due to all the new and review items. Although it was a good project to get things moving again with C++.
This helped to get my envirorment setup for upcoming programs.
Excited for others to come.
